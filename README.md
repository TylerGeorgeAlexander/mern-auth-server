## get your .env right:
#### backend .env
* JWT_SECRET = 
* REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET = 
* SESSION_EXPIRY = 60 * 15
* REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY = 60 * 60 * 24 * 30
* MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING =
* COOKIE_SECRET = 
* WHITELISTED_DOMAINS = http://localhost:3000

##### want to generate some quick secrets? me too! run this command and paste unique ones in that .env:
- `openssl rand -base64 172 | tr -d '\ n'`
- [Read an Article - JSON Web Token (JWT) â€” The right way of implementing, with Node.js](https://siddharthac6.medium.com/json-web-token-jwt-the-right-way-of-implementing-with-node-js-65b8915d550e)

#### frontend .env
* REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT = http://localhost:8081/

## steps:
1. ```yarn install``` or ```npm i``` 
2. ```yarn start```
3. add new terminal
4. ```cd mern-auth-client```
5. ```yarn install``` or ```npm i``` 
6. ```yarn start```

# and then what?
* you did it! you set up mongodb, express, react, and node in a full stack application that utilizes passport and jwt for authentication
## gratz
* don't delay start today!
* that means go build
* seriously go build
* stop doing tutorials
* go write some spaghetti code
* make a controller
* continue that MVC architecture
* add CRUD
* go build

#### notes:
* this project uses cookies for storing the jwt
* google chrome will not generate the token with localhost
* in chrome => refreshing the page in development localhost will log you out
* in in firefox and safari => refreshing maintains login state/context while testing in localhost
